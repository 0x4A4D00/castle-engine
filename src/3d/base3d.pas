      Should take into account both collidable and visible objects.
      For examples, invisible walls (not visible) and fake walls (not collidable)
      should all be accounted here.

      As it's a @italic(bounding) volume, it may naturally be slightly too large
      (although, for the same of various optimizations, you should try
      to make it as tight as reasonably possible.) For now, it's also OK
      to make it a little too small (nothing bad will happen).
      Although all currently implemeted descendants (TVRMLScene, TVRMLAnimation,
      more) guarantee it's never too small. }
