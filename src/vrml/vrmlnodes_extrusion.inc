  { Utility for dealing with Extrusion.

   Calculating vertices (and other properties) of Extrusion
   is non-trivial enough to be separated into this file. We want to reuse
   this by TNodeExtrusion.BoundingBox calculation,
   TNodeExtrusion.Triangulate etc. }

      Remember that this can be -1, if no spine points are defined.

      0..High. }

      This is a stronger condition
      than just a SpineClosed: whole SpineTransformTo1st must be
      guaranteed the same at the beginning and end. The Extrusion rules are such
      that closed spine -> always produces the same automatic orientation
      calculated at the beginning and end (X, Y, Z vectors in
