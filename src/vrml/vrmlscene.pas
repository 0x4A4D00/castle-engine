      The actual edge's vertexes are not recorded here (this would prevent
      using TVRMLScene.ShareManifoldAndBorderEdges with various scenes from
      the same animation). You should get them as the VertexIndex
      and (VertexIndex+1) mod 3 vertexes of the first triangle

    { These are vertexes at VertexIndex and (VertexIndex+1)mod 3 positions,
      but @italic(only at generation of manifold edges time).
      Like said in VertexIndex, keeping here actual vertex info would prevent
      TVRMLScene.ShareManifoldAndBorderEdges. However, using these when generating
      makes a great speed-up when generating manifold edges.

      Memory cost is acceptable: assume we have model with 10 000 faces,
      so 15 000 edges (assuming it's correctly closed manifold), so we waste
      15 000 * 2 * SizeOf(TVector3Single) = 360 000 bytes... that's really nothing
      to worry (we waste much more on other things).

      Checked with "The Castle": indeed, this costs about 1 MB memory
      (out of 218 MB...), with really lot of creatures... On the other hand,
      this causes small speed-up when loading: loading creatures is about
      5 seconds faster (18 with, 23 without this).

      So memory loss is small, speed gain is noticeable (but still small),
      implementation code is a little simplified, so I'm keeping this.
      Also, in the future, maybe it will be sensible
      to use this for actual shadow quad rendering, in cases when we know that
      TVRMLScene.ShareManifoldAndBorderEdges was not used to make it. }

  { These are various features that may be freed by
    TVRMLScene.FreeResources.

    @italic(Warning): This is for experienced usage of TVRMLScene.
    Everything is explained in detail below, but still  --- if you have some
    doubts, or you just don't observe any memory shortage in your program,
    it's probably best to not use TVRMLScene.FreeResources.

    @unorderedList(
      @item(For frRootNode, you @italic(may) get nasty effects including crashes
        if you will use this in a wrong way.)

      @item(For frTextureDataInNodes, frBackgroundImageInNodes and TrianglesList,
        if you will free them unnecessarily
        (i.e. you will use it after you freed it), it will be automatically
        recreated on next use. So everything will work correctly, but you
        will experience unnecessary slowdown if we will need to recreate
        exactly the same resource over and over again.)

      @item(For frTextureDataInNodes, frBackgroundImageInNodes and frRootNode, note that
        freeing these resources too eagerly may make image cache
        (see ImagesCache) less effective. In normal circumstances,
        if you will use the same cache instance throughout the program,
        loaded images are reused. If you free frTextureDataInNodes or frRootNode
        too early, you may remove them from the cache too early, and lose
        a chance to reuse them. So you may cause unnecessary slowdown
        of preparing models, e.g. inside PrepareResources.)

  }
  TVRMLSceneFreeResource = (
    { Free (and set to nil) RootNode of the scene. Works only if
      TVRMLScene.OwnsRootNode is @true (the general assertion is that
      TVRMLScene will @italic(never) free RootNode when OwnsRootNode is
      @false).

      frRootNode allows you to save some memory, but may be quite dangerous.
      You have to be careful then about what methods from the scene you use.
      Usually, you will prepare appropriate things first (usually by
      TVRMLGLScene.PrepareResources), and after that call FreeResources
      with frRootNode.

      Note that event processing is impossible without RootNode nodes and
      fields and routes, so don't ever use this if you want to set
      TVRMLScene.ProcessEvents to @true.

      Note that if you will try to use a resource that was already freed
      by frRootNode, you may even get segfault (access violation).
      So be really careful, be sure to prepare everything first by
      TVRMLGLScene.PrepareResources or such. }
    frRootNode,

    { Unloads the texture images/videos allocated in VRML texture nodes.

      It's useful if you know that you already prepared everything
      that needed the texture images, and you will not need texture images
      later. For TVRMLGLScene this means that you use Optimization
      method other than roNone,
      and you already did PrepareResources (so textures are already loaded to OpenGL),
      and your code will not access TextureImage / TextureVideo anymore.
      This is commonly @true for various games.

      Then you can call this to free some resources.

      Note that if you made an accident and you will use some TextureImage or
      TextureVideo after FreeResources, then you will get no crash,
      but texture image will be simply reloaded. So you may experience
      slowdown if you inappropriately use this feature.

      Oh, and note that if frRootNode and OwnsRootNode, then this is not
      necessary (as freeing RootNode also frees texture nodes, along with
      their texture). }

  { VRML scene, a final class to handle VRML models
    (with the exception of rendering, which is delegated to descendants,
    like TVRMLGLScene for OpenGL).

    Provides a lot of useful functionality. Simple loading of the scene (@link(Load)
    method), calculating various things (like @link(BoundingBox) method).

    The @link(Shapes) tree provides a simple processed scene information,
    alternative to traversing the complicated VRML/X3D nodes graph.
    The basic idea is to have at the same time full VRML/X3D graph
    of the scene (in @link(RootNode)) and a simple view of the same scene
    (in @link(Shapes)).

    VRML scene also takes care of initiating and managing VRML events
    and routes mechanism (see ProcessEvents).

    The actual VRML/X3D nodes graph is stored in the RootNode property.
    Remember that if you directly change the fields/nodes within the RootNode,
    this scene object must be notified about this.
    The simplest way to do this is to use only TVRMLField.Send to change
    the fields' values. Or you can call TVRMLField.Changed after each change.
    Or you will have to call ChangedField or ChangedAll method
    of this class.
    If the scene is changed by VRML events, all changes are automagically
    acted upon, so you don't have to do anything.

    For more-or-less static scenes,
    many things are cached and work very quickly.
    E.g. methods BoundingBox, VerticesCount, TrianglesCount, @link(Shapes)
    cache their results so after the first call to @link(TrianglesCount)
    next calls to the same method will return instantly (assuming
    that scene did not change much). }

    { Create octree containing all triangles or shapes from our scene.
      Create octree, inits it with our BoundingBox
      and adds shapes (or all triangles from our Shapes).

      Triangles are generated using calls like
      @code(Shape.Triangulate(false, ...)).
      Note that OverTriangulate parameter for Triangulate call above is @false:
      it shouldn't be needed to have triangle octree with over-triangulate
      (over-triangulate is only for rendering with Gouraud shading).

      If Collidable, then only the collidable, or at least "pickable",
      triangles are generated. Which means that children of
      Collision nodes with collide = FALSE (or proxy <> nil) are not placed here.
      Otherwise, only the visible (not necessarily collidable)
      items are placed in the octree.

      If ProgressTitle <> '' (and progress is not active already,
      so we avoid starting "progress bar within progress bar",
      and progress user interface is initialized)
      then it uses @link(Progress) while building octree.

      Remember that triangle octree has references to Shape nodes
      inside RootNode vrml tree and to State objects inside
      our @link(Shapes) tree.
      And shape octree has references to our @link(Shapes) tree.
      So you must rebuild such octree when this object changes.

      Note: remember that this is a function and it returns
      created octree object. It does *not* set value of any
      OctreeXxx property, and the returned octree is not managed
      by this scene.

      Everything in my units is done in the spirit
      that you can create as many octrees as you want for a given scene
      (both octrees based on triangles and based on shapes).
      Also, in some special cases an octree may be constructed in
      some special way (not only using @link(CreateShapeOctree)
      or @link(CreateTriangleOctree)) so that it doesn't contain
      the whole scene from some TVRMLScene object, or it contains
      the scene from many TVRMLScene objects, or something else.

      What I want to say is that it's generally wrong to think of
      an octree as something that maps 1-1 to some TVRMLScene object.
      Octrees, as implemented here, are a lot more flexible.

      it's sometimes not desirable to call them immediately

      This class can be viewed as a wrapper around specified RootNode.

      As such it is allowed to change contents of RootNode
      (however, this object requires notification of such changes
      via ChangedXxx methods, see their docs).
      Moreover it is allowed to change value of RootNode
      and even to set RootNode to nil for some time.

      This is useful for programs like view3dscene, that want to
      have one TVRMLScene for all the lifetime and only
      replace RootNode value from time to time.
      This is useful because it allows to change viewed model
      (by changing RootNode) while preserving values of things
      like Attributes properties in subclass @link(TVRMLGLScene).
      This is also used internally when user clicks on Anchor node,
      if you have ProcessEvents.

      That's why it is possible to change RootNode and it is even
      possible to set it to nil. And when When RootNode = nil everything
      should work -- you can query such scene (with RootNode = nil)
      for Vertices/TrianglesCount (answer will be 0),
      for BoundingBox (answer will be EmptyBox3D),
      you can render such scene (nothing will be rendered) etc.
      Scene RootNode = nil will act quite like a Scene with
      e.g. no TVRMLGeometryNode nodes.

      Always call ChangedAll when you changed RootNode.

      Note that there is also a trick to conserve memory use.
      After you've done PrepareResources some things are precalculated here,
      and RootNode is actually not used, unless you use ProcessEvents.
      So you can free RootNode
      (and set it to nil here) @italic(without calling ChangedAll)
      and some things will just continue to work, unaware of the fact
      that the underlying RootNode structure is lost.
      Note that this is still considered a "dirty trick", and you will
      have to be extra-careful then about what methods/properties
      from this class. Generally, use only things that you prepared
      with PrepareResources. So e.g. calling Render or using BoundingBox.
      If all your needs are that simple, then you can use this trick
      to save some memory. This is actually useful when using TVRMLGLAnimation,
      as it creates a lot of intermediate node structures and TVRMLScene

      This is actually a hierarchy of octrees: scene is partitioned
      first into Shapes (each instance of VRML geometry node),
      and then each Shape has an octree of triangles inside.

      This octree is useful for all kinds of collision detection.
      Compared to OctreeCollidableTriangles, it is (very slightly on typical scenes)
      less efficient, but it can also be updated very fast.
      For example, merely transforming some Shape means that only
      one item needs to be moved in the top-level shape tree.
      So this is the most important structure for collision detection on
      dynamic scenes.

      You can use OctreeCollisions to get either OctreeDynamicCollisions
      or OctreeCollidableTriangles, whichever is available.

      Add ssDynamicCollisions to @link(Spatial) property to have this available,

    { GetViewpoint and GetPerspectiveViewpoint return the properties
      of the defined Viewpoint in VRML file, or some default viewpoint
      properties if no viewpoint is found in RootNode graph. They seek for
      nodes Viewpoint (for VRML 97) or OrthoViewpoint (any X3DViewpointNode
      actually, for X3D), PerspectiveCamera and OrthographicCamera
      (for VRML 1.0) in the scene graph.

      GetPerspectiveViewpoint omits OrthographicCamera andy OrthoViewpoint.

      If ViewpointDescription = '', they return the first found viewpoint node.
      Otherwise, they look for Viewpoint or OrthoViewpoint (any X3DViewpointNode
      actually) with description field mathing given string.

      If some viewpoint will be found (in the active VRML graph
      under RootNode), then "out" parameters
      will be calculated to this viewpoint position, direction etc.
      If no such thing is found in the VRML graph, then returns
      default viewpoint properties from VRML spec (CamPos = (0, 0, 1),
      CamDir = (0, 0, -1), CamUp = GravityUp = (0, 1, 0), CamType = ctPerspective).

      If camera properties were found in some node,
      it returns this node. Otherwise it returns nil.

      is that you don't @italic(have) to care about details of

      for this scene.

      Additionally, TDynTrianglesShadowCastersArray contains some
      additional information needed for rendering with shadows:
      currently, this means TDynTrianglesShadowCastersArray.OpaqueCount.

      Results of these functions are cached, and are also owned by this object.
      So don't modify it, don't free it. }
    function TrianglesListShadowCasters: TDynTrianglesShadowCastersArray;

    { ManifoldEdges is a list of edges that have exactly @bold(two) neighbor
      triangles, and BorderEdges is a list of edges that have exactly @bold(one)
      neighbor triangle. These are crucial for rendering shadows using shadow
      volumes.

      Edges with more than two neighbors are allowed. If an edge has an odd
      number of neighbors, it will be placed in BorderEdges. Every other pair
      of neighbors will be "paired" and placed as one manifold edge inside
      ManifoldEdges. So actually edge with exactly 1 neighbor (odd number,
      so makes one BorderEdges item) and edge with exactly 2 neighbors
      (even number, one pair of triangles, makes one item in ManifoldEdges)
      --- they are just a special case of a general rule, that allows any
      neighbors number.

      Note that vertexes must be consistently ordered in triangles.
      For two neighboring triangles, if one triangle's edge has
      order V0, V1, then on the neighbor triangle the order must be reversed
      (V1, V0). This is true in almost all situations, for example
      if you have a closed solid object and all outside faces are ordered
      consistently (all CCW or all CW).
      Failure to order consistently will result in edges not being "paired",
      i.e. we will not recognize that some 2 edges are in fact one edge between
      two neighboring triangles --- and this will result in more edges in
      BorderEdges.

      Both of these lists are calculated at once, i.e. when you call ManifoldEdges
      or BorderEdges for the 1st time, actually both ManifoldEdges and
      BorderEdges are calculated at once. If all edges are in ManifoldEdges,
      then the scene is a correct closed manifold, or rather it's composed
      from any number of closed manifolds.

      Results of these functions are cached, and are also owned by this object.
      So don't modify it, don't free it.

      This uses TrianglesListShadowCasters.

      BorderEdges calls. The values passed here will @italic(not
      be owned) by this object --- you gave this, you're responsible for
      freeing it.

      This is handy if you know that this scene has the same
      ManifoldEdges and BorderEdges contents as some other scene. In particular,
      this is extremely handy in cases of animations in TVRMLGLAnimation,
      where all scenes actually need only a single instance of TDynManifoldEdgeArray
      and TDynBorderEdgeArray,
      this greatly speeds up TVRMLGLAnimation loading and reduces memory use.

      Note that passing here as values the same references
      that are already returned by ManifoldEdges / BorderEdges is always
      guaranteed to be a harmless operation. If ManifoldEdges  / BorderEdges
      was owned by this object,

      values set here are assumed to be owned by something else). }

      is done automatically for you when ProcessEvents is changed
      between @true and @false, including when TVRMLScene is destroyed.
      However, if you process RootNode graph
      and extract some node from it (that is, delete node from our
      RootNode graph, but instead of freeing it you insert it
      into some other VRML graph) you must call it to manually
      "untie" this node (and all it's children) from this TVRMLScene instance.

      Reason: when ProcessEvents is activated,
      we set Self as node's EventsEngine to get event
      changes notifications to ChangedXxx methods.
      When ProcessEvents is deactivated (including when this TVRMLScene
      instance is released) we revert this. If you add new node
      to VRML graph, we make sure (in ChangedAll) that EventsEngine
      is set correctly for all new nodes. Buf if you deleted a node
      from our graph, we have no chance to remove this...
      You have to call UnregisterProcessEvents then manually,
      if you don't want the Node to be "tied" to our TVRMLScene.

      In really really corner cases, when you're not sure whether you
      this Node with all it's children, you should make sure to call
      this before calling ChangedAll. This way, this will unregister
      this Node and all it's children from our event processing,
      and ChangedAll will re-register again these children which are
      detected to still be part of our graph. }

      further events until it's deactivated (e.g. when you set
      PointingDeviceActive := false, which means that user released mouse
      button). This means that when user moves the mouse while given
      sensors are active, he can move mouse over other items, even the ones

      This is sometimes useful, because PointingDeviceMove may save

      You could free it by calling

    { Update camera to the currently bound VRML/X3D viewpoint.
      When no viewpoint is currently bound, we will go to a suitable
      viewpoint to see the whole scene (based on a scene bounding box).

      The initial camera vectors (TCamera.InitialPosition,
      TCamera.InitialDirection, TCamera.InitialUp, TWalkCamera.GravityUp)
      are set to the current viewpoint. This is done
      regardless of the RelativeCameraTransform value.

      How current camera vectors change depends on RelativeCameraTransform:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(RelativeCameraTransform = @false means that we just
          set current vectors to the initial vectors.
          In other words, camera jumps to the viewpoint.

          In this case, AllowTransitionAnimate determines if we allow
          moving camera by a smooth transition. If this is @true,
          and also NavigationInfo allows it (see CameraTransition),
          then camera will jump smoothy. Otherwise camera will jump
          to viewpoint immediately.)

        @item(RelativeCameraTransform = @true means that we translate/rotate
          the current camera in the same manner as initial camera
          changed. This is suitable when you change transformation, position
          or orientation of the VRML/X3D Viewpoint node: conceptually,
          there exists a "user" camera transformation that is the child
          of the viewpoint. When viewpoint is moved, then the current
          camera moves with it.)

      Currently, this is used by TVRMLGLScene if you use

      and objects appear progressively in the view. When you make
      a sudden camera jump/change, this assumption breaks, so it's
      better to resign from occlusion query for the very next frame.

            "Events are not generated if the geometry itself is
            animating and moving underneath the pointing device."

            I understand that they mean that you don't have to call
            PointingDeviceMove continously, you can only check this on
            actual mouse move. That is, isOver state changes are not
            intended to be caught immediately if they happened because
            the geometry is animating. But, still, all isOver changes *are*
            reported. I hope they don't mean that isOver changes because
            of underlying geometry animating should not be reported at all.

            The latter interpretation:
            - Would be unhandy for implementation, as I would have to call
              raycollision twice for each MouseMove (to get
              OverPointBeforeMove and OverPoint).
            - Would be unhandy for users. You want
              to catch isOver changes eventually, right? Otherwise,
              user may be forced to move mouse out and then back in to generate
              isOver event = TRUE. Worse, user has to move mouse inside and
              then back outside to generate isOver = FALSE event.
