# Generics.Collections
FreePascal Generics.Collections library (TList, TDictionary, THashMap and more...)

This directory contains the source code of the Generics.Collections
and related units. It is used only when compiling with FPC 3.0.x,
since FPC >= 3.1.1 already contains this code as part of the standard library,
and Delphi has it's own implementation of Generics.Collections.

The original version of these units were developed by Maciej Izak
in https://github.com/dathox/generics.collections .

The latest version of these units, inside the FPC SVN repository,
can be seen on:
- https://svn.freepascal.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/packages/rtl-generics/
- https://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/trunk/packages/rtl-generics/

You can do "svn checkout ..." on the latter URL to easily download whole directory.
It contains various examples using Generics.Collections too.

Oh, and you can also take a look at the short overview of
Generics.Collections by Michalis Kamburelis on
http://castle-engine.io/modern_pascal_introduction.html#generic-containers-section .
