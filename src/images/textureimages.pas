{ Handling of images that will be used as textures.

{ Some internal comments about why this unit is needed at all.
  For a long, long time all my images were represented by TImage class.
  There was no DDS, no S3TC and everything was beautiful and simple.

  Well, actually, there was one ugly thing: everything that didn't depend
  on OpenGL had to take some parameter like AllowedImageClasses,
  and accept it (and some routines didn't accept it in reality,
  because TImagesCache didn't honour it, because it would severely
  complicate it for no practical gain).

  When DDS and S3TC compressed textures came in, problems started.
  A lot of routines dealing with texture had to be extended to accept
  TS3TCImage, and generally TEncodedImage. That was good, but it made
  loading images for them really uncomfortable: special code to
  take DDS, and optionally extract S3TC from DDS, was needed,
  instead of previous LoadImage. Moreover, TImagesCache.LoadImage_IncReference
  couldn't be used.

  One solution, that I was toying with for 2 days, was to make more things
  to accept TEncodedImage instead of just TImage. For example,
  allow LoadImage to return any TEncodedImage, and let called specify
  whether TS3TCImage is allowed by AllowedImageClasses parameter to
  LoadImage. But this was flawed.
  It required a huge lot of existing code to be changed, basically
  just to fail gracefully if "not (Image is TImage)", which was ugly.
  If you need class checks and casts everywhere around, then something
  is just wrong. Moreover, and this is really the key point, note that
  for textures even TEncodedImage is not enough: eventually more texture
  routines should know about full DDS file, to be able to use mipmaps
  from DDS file. Trying to push this inside normal LoadImage would be simply
  wrong. And no, I don't want to make TDDSImage an ancestor or descendant
  of TEncodedImage --- logically, they should stay independent classes.

  The right solution turned out to be this trivial unit. We simply
  admit that we need different routines to "load texture" and "load simple
  editable image", and we need different cache classes for them.
  Texture loading and cache support TEncodedImage (so they allow S3TC)
  and allow returning associated DDS file, so texture routines are happy.

  As a side result, this also eliminates the need for all those
  AllowedImageClasses fields in various VRML texture etc. nodes.
  This unit, although not dependent on OpenGL, knows which image memory
  formats are suitable for textures, and that's it.

{ Load image suitable for a texture.
  This will load image to memory formats supported by common
  3D libraries (like OpenGL), for example it will never return TRGBFloatImage
  (although OpenGL may support it, but we cannot be sure at this point).
  It may return S3TC encoded image.

  If the image comes from a DDS file, it will also return it
  (if not, DDS returned will be @nil). This allows you to e.g. use
  texture mipmaps recorded there. Note that DDS.OwnsFirstImage is set
  to @false, so you can always safely free everything by simple
  @code(FreeAndNil(Image); FreeAndNil(DDS);).

  Overloaded version without DDS parameter assumes you're
  not interested in this information (still it handles DDS files of course,
  it just doesn't return DDS object instance).

      { We cannot simply assert

          C^.DDS = DDS

        because when textures have many references,
        some references may be with and some without DDS information.
        We don't want to force all references to the same URL to always
        have or never have DDS information. (This would be uncomfortable
        for caller, as different nodes may share textures, e.g. VRML Background
        and ImageTexture nodes. They would all be forced to remember DDS
        information this way.)

        So we have to always keep DDS information in the cache,
        and free it, regardless of whether called knows this DDS information.

        Only if passed DDS <> nil (we know caller keeps it) then we can
        check it for correctness. }
