{ Logging. Log has to be activated in your program (nothing in the
  kambi_vrml_game_engine units activates it automatically !) by InitializeLog.
  Various units of my engine print some logging info when @link(Log) is true.

  Prints log messages to StdOut, not to some external file.
  This is most useful and common behavior on Unixes.
  It also removed any problems with users asking "where can I find
  the log file?". The downside is that Windows users
  have to explicitly redirect StdOut of the GUI program to get the log. }

interface

{ Is logging active ? Initially no. Activate by InitializeLog. }

procedure InitializeLog(const ProgramVersion: string);

{ Write to log file. Call this only if @link(Log) = @true.

  It was consciously decided that this will @italic(not be ignored) when
  @link(Log) = false, instead the programmer will have to always explicitly
  check @link(Log) value before calling this.
  That's because you shouldn't even waste time on constructing LogMessage
  for it when @link(Log) = false. }
procedure WritelnLog(const Title: string; const LogMessage: string);

{ Write to log file. Call this only if @link(Log) = @true.

  This is a shortcut for @code(WritelnLog(Title, Format(LogMessageBase, Args))). }
procedure WritelnLog(const Title: string; const LogMessageBase: string;
  const Args: array of const);

{ Just like WritelnLog, but assumes that LogMessage already contains
  final newline --- so it doesn't add additional newline. }
procedure WriteLog(const Title: string; const LogMessage: string);

{ Just like WritelnLog, but wraps inside Title markers, so that
  it's nicely formatted even when LogMessage is multiline.
  LogMessage may be multiline and terminated by final newline. }

  { Ideally, check for "StdOutStream = nil" should be all that is needed,
    and wrapping WritelnStr inside try...except should not be needed.
    But... see StdOutStream comments: you cannot
    depend on the fact that "StdOutStream <> nil means that stdout
    is actually available (because user redirected stdout etc.). }

    Otherwise (when FLog := true would be done at the beginning of
    InitializeLog), if something is done in finally..end clauses surrounding
    InitializeLog, and it does "if Log then WritelnLog..." then it would
    try to write something to log --- even though we just jumped using
    RaiseStdOutNotAvail. }
