unit AllKambiBaseUnits;

{ This is automatically generated unit, useful to compile all units
  in this directory (and OS-specific subdirectories like
  unix/, linux/, and windows/).
  Don't edit.
  Don't use this unit in your programs, it's just not for this.
  Generated by Kambi's Elisp function all-units-in-dir. }
