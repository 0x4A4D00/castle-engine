This is a simple VRML browser in Lazarus, based on TKamVRMLBrowser component
of our engine. Something like "mini-view3dscene" using Lazarus.

Possibly real view3dscene in the future will be based on Lazarus.
This will not happen soon (TOpenGLControl lacks stable GTK 2 support,
anti-aliasing, and see various quirks in "TODO" section below ---
this is all much better/stable with our TGLWindow).
But it's possible in the future.

Compiling:

- Install standard Lazarus package with TOpenGLControl

- Compile and install packages kambi_units and kambi_components,
  see ../../../packages/

- Then just open and compile this program as usual from Lazarus.

Usage:

- Open any 3D file supported by view3dscene (VRML 1.0, 2.0, X3D, 3DS ---
  see view3dscene docs [http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/view3dscene.php]).
  You can open using "File -> Open" menu item
  or just pass filename on command-line.

- To move in the scene, all the view3dscene keys in Walk mode work
  (Arrows, PageUp/Down, Insert/Delete, Comma/Period etc.).
  Remember that you must have focus on 3D area to use them ---
  press Escape (menu item "View -> Switch focus to 3D area") when needed.

- You can also change camera vectors by hand if you like ---
  just modify values in edit boxes at the bottom and press "Change".

----------------------------------------
TODO:

- Ctrl+O key shortcut doesn't work when standing on TEdit boxes
  (FocusableControl hack means that this also occurs
  when focus is on 3D area).

- Only on Windows: I had to write
  GLControlResize(GLControl) instead of GLControl.Resize
  in TMain.OpenScene. Investigate, submit Lazarus bug.
  Fixed now?

- GLControl.ReleaseAllKeysAndMouse should be called when
  user expands the menu with mouse. How to catch this?

- FocusableControl is an ugly hack --- this should be corrected
  in Lazarus TOpenGLControl. Especially hardcoding VK_TAB there
  is just awful.

- When Position was poDefault the form kept getting small size
  each time when I open it under Windows. It seems that under Windows
  when Position = poDefault, it is used like that even in design-time
  (in Linux/GTK it was working correctly).
  Investigate, submit Lazazarus bug.
