Dynamic ambient occlusion, based on GPU Gems 2 chapter 14, online on

(PDF version on

Idea:

- Crude assumption: model is actually a number of elements, each element
  corresponding to a vertex of orig model, with normal and area correctly
  calculated.
  See menu "Program -> Show Elements".

- Encode elements info into the texture.

- On each vertex do (in vertex shader): calculate AO using elements info.

TODO: our current method of generating elements works only for nodes
with explicit vertexes, so will not work for VRML primitives (sphere,
cone and and such).
