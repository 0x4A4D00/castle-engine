This is a demo implementation of something like "mini-view3dscene"
using Lazarus.

The intention is to make development of view3dscene much easier
by using all LCL visual things, and designing UI visually.

The actual rendering code is adapted mostly from simpleViewModel
and simpleViewModel_2 example programs (I didn't want to start
with adapting a whole view3dscene code).
But, unlike in simpleViewModel, user
is able to open new scene file while the program is running
(just like in view3dscene).

Yes, eventually my intention is to really change real view3dscene
into a normal Lazarus program. But some code will have
to be written for this to really happen, also GTK 2 support should
be improved in Lazarus, also I'll also want to make sure that
TOpenGLControl is as stable as my GLWindow unit.
This program is a start of such effort.
It shows that it's possible (and that it's not trivial ---
there are many issues in this program that must be handled
before it can be accepted as a good foundation of next view3dscene
release).

Compiling:

- Install standard Lazarus package with TOpenGLControl

- Compile and install packages kambi_units and kambi_components,
  see ../../../packages/

- Then just open and compile this program as usual from Lazarus.

Usage:

- Open any 3D file supported by view3dscene (VRML 1.0, 3DS ---
  see view3dscene docs). You can open using "File -> Open" menu item
  or just pass filename on command-line.

- To move in the scene, all the view3dscene keys in Walk mode work
  (Arrows, PageUp/Down, Insert/Delete, Comma/Period etc.).
  Remember that you must have focus on 3D area to use them ---
  press Escape (menu item "View -> Switch focus to 3D area") when needed.

- You can also change camera vectors by hand if you like ---
  just modify values in edit boxes at the bottom and press "Change".

----------------------------------------
TODO:

- Ctrl+O key shortcut doesn't work when standing on TEdit boxes
  (EditGLControlFocus hack means that this also occurs
  when focus is on 3D area).

- Only on Windows: I had to write
  GLControlResize(GLControl) instead of GLControl.Resize
  in TMain.OpenScene. Investigate, submit Lazazarus bug.

- GLControl.ReleaseAllKeysAndMouse should be called when
  user expands the menu with mouse. How to catch this ?

- EditGLControlFocus is an ugly hack --- this should be corrected
  in Lazarus TOpenGLControl. Especially hardcoding VK_TAB there
  is just awful.

- When Position was poDefault the form kept getting small size
  each time when I open it under Windows. It seems that under Windows
  when Position = poDefault, it is used like that even in design-time
  (in Linux/GTK it was working correctly).
  Investigate, submit Lazazarus bug.
