This is a demo implementation of something like "mini-view3dscene"
using Lazarus.

The intention is to make development of view3dscene much easier
by using all LCL visual things, and designing UI visually.

The actual rendering code is adapted mostly from simpleViewModel
and simpleViewModel_2 example programs (I didn't want to start
with adapting a whole view3dscene code).
But, unlike in simpleViewModel, user
is able to open new scene file while the program is running
(just like in view3dscene).

Yes, eventually my intention is to really change real view3dscene
into a normal Lazarus program. But some code will have
to be written for this to really happen, also GTK 2 support should
be improved in Lazarus, also I'll also want to make sure that
TOpenGLControl is as stable as my GLWindow unit.
This program is a start of such effort.
It shows that it's possible (and that it's not trivial ---
there are many issues in this program that must be handled
before it can be accepted as a good foundation of next view3dscene
release).

Compiling:
- Install standard Lazarus package with TOpenGLControl
- Compile and install packages kambi_units and kambi_components,
  see ../../../packages/
- Then just open and compile this program as usual from Lazarus.

TODO:
- GLControl.ReleaseAllKeysAndMouse should be called when
  user expands the menu with mouse.
- EditGLControlFocus is an ugly hack --- this should be corrected
  in Lazarus TOpenGLControl. Especially hardcoding VK_TAB there
  is just awful.
