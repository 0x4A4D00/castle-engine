Precomputed Shadow Fields for Dynamic Scenes
Video and paper from http://www.kunzhou.net/

Video notes: note that morphing objects is problematic, since shadow fields
are precalculated for given geometry. They admit this (when talking
about "each leg has it's own SF", and when video texture light has very
few FPS (400 MB according to paper)).

TODO: My current demo implementation in shadow_fields.pasprogram:
- there is only one shadow caster (although may be instanced many times)
- there is only one shadow receiver (this also means that shadow casters
  and receivers are different things, no shadowing between shadow casters)
- there is only one local light
- there is only one environment light
- also, there is an additional point in 3D space that you can move
  (to inspect environment maps at arbitrary points in 3D space)
