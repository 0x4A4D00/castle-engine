# Kambi notes: it assumes that texture is always enabled. IOW, this will
# mix with current texture, regardless of current texture enabled state.

# Simple program to show how to code up the default texture environment.

ATTRIB tex = fragment.texcoord;      #first set of texture coordinates
ATTRIB col = fragment.color.primary; #diffuse interpolated color

OUTPUT outColor = result.color;

TEMP tmp;

TXP tmp, tex, texture, 2D;           #sample the texture

MUL outColor, tmp, col;              #perform the modulation
