{ Pass on command-line the filename ("-" means stdin) of 3D model file.
  If this file was generated by the standard Blender VRML 1.0, 2.0 or
  X3D exporter, we will output Blender object and mesh names, if available,
  for shapes inside.

  This is useful if your game wants to use Blender object / mesh names,
  for whatever purpose (for example, maybe you want to mark by special
  names some objects in Blender, and you want to detect this inside the game). }
