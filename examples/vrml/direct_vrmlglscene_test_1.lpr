{ Low-level demo how to access TVRMLGLScene without a SceneManager, part 1.
  This is highly discouraged now --- SceneManager does a lot of stuff
  for you, results in more functional and at the same time shorter code.
  This demo remains just to show that it's possible (even if
  uncomfortable) to work without the SceneManager.

  It loads a model from a filename given as command-line parameter.
  Supports all known model formats (VRML, X3D, Collada etc.,
  for a full list of supported formats see view3dscene documentation).

  It allows user to walk/examine the scene by a Camera,
  see view3dscene documentation for keys/mouse controls available,
  [http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/view3dscene.php#section_keys].

  Thanks to using TGLUIWindow class, that descends
  from TGLWindowDemo, this program automatically handles keys Escape (Quit)
  and F11 (Swap fullscreen) and displays FPS on window's Caption.

  For the sake of simplicity, this example takes some shortcuts
  (that are fixed in the direct_vrmlglscene_test_2.lpr):
  - Collision detection is *not* done.
    We even turn off gravity (because it would make camera fall down infinitely,
    since without collision detection you sink through the floor.)
  - Scene is rendered without frustum culling, since we do not pass
    current frustum to Scene.Render.
  - If you will load large VRML scene, then right after program start
    you may notice for a very short time that your camera moves too fast.
