Example of a 3D FPS game using "Castle Game Engine".

The example code, as well as the data files in data/ subdirectory,
are full of (hopefully) helpful comments :)
You will probably want to read engine tutorial,
see DRAFT.engine_tutorial.txt ,
along with browsing this code. And the engine reference
http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/apidoc/html/index.html
should be helpful too :)
