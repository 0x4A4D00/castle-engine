<!--
  Define the "Knight" creature properties. See README_about_index_xml_files.txt
  for extensive documentation of available properties, in short:

  - name: used to refer to this creature from ObjectPascal code,
    e.g. in Resources.FindName('Knight').
    Also to create placeholders to place initial creatures of this kind on level:
   (place on the level, in Blender, object named 'CasResKnight'.

  - type: indicates ObjectPascal class used to handle this creature,
    in this case TWalkAttackCreatureResource (and the
    TWalkAttackCreatureResource, in turn, indicates that particular creature
    on level will use TWalkAttackCreature class).
    This is an intelligent walking-attacking creature.

  - model: animations 3D models. There are many ways to define them,
    see DRAFT.modeling_tutorial.txt. In this case we use KAnim to
    export animations from Blender to KAnim using our exporter on
    http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/blender.php .
