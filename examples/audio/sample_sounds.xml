<!--
   This is a sample sounds.xml file, usable by XmlSoundEngine unit.
   Configuration of game sounds. Each sound has a <sound> element.

   `name' is the unique sound name, as defined in TXmlSoundEngine.SoundNames.
   Currently you can have multiple <sound> elements for the same
   name, and they will be processed in order - - - but don't depend
   on it. For future safety each <sound> element should have different
   name. In the future this file will allow you to add new sounds,
   and name them any way you like - - - for now, you are constrained
   to sounds defined and named in TXmlSoundEngine.SoundNames property.

   `file_name' attribute defaults to element_name + '.wav', so in the most
   common situation, when sound named xxx has the filename xxx.wav,
   you don't have to specify filename. You have to specify file_name
   only if the sound needs different file_name (for whatever reason),
   or when the sound currently has no file_name (which means that it will
   not be ever played). In the last case, you should set file_name to
   empty string, i.e. file_name="".

   Note that file_name is relative to the location of this index.xml file.
   Since most sounds should be in this directory, usually you just don't
   specify path here.

   `gain', `min_gain', `max_gain' set loudness.
   By default (if not specified) gain is 1, min/max are 0/1.

   `default_importance' is the sound importance, for AL sound manager.
   You can place here a simple unsigned int value, but it's strongly advised
   to use one of predefined special values, like "max".
   For "The Castle" only: more predefined importances are
   "player" or "default_creature" or "level_event".

   For more details see declaration of TSoundInfo record in XmlSoundEngine unit.

   Comments for "The Castle" only:
   Note that you can change this file while the game is running,
   and reload it by "Reload sounds/index.xml" command from the debug menu.
   This allows you to easily test various sound settings without
   restarting the actual game program.
   Note that when using "Reload sounds/index.xml" command:
   - Don't change the "file_name" attribute. I.e. you must exit
     and run the game again to use new sound file_name.
     "Reload sounds/index.xml" is useful only when playing with other sound
     attributes.
   - Changes will only be reflected in newly started sounds,
     not in currently played sounds.

<sounds>
  <!-- Example simplest sound entry. -->
  <sound name="sound1" />

  <!-- Example sound with some non-default attributes. -->
  <sound name="player_pick_item"
    gain="0.5" min_gain="0" max_gain="1" default_importance="max"/>

  <!-- Example sounds that have non-standard filename (i.e. filename
       is not simply the sound name + '.wav' extension). -->
  <sound name="player_lava_pain" file_name="doom/dsplpain.wav" />
  <sound name="intro_music" file_name="intro_music.ogg" />

  <!-- Example sound that has explicit empty file_name, to indicate
       that the sound doesn't exist actually.
       Such sound can be treated as usual by your program using
       XmlSoundEngine unit, you can pass it to Sound or Sound3d
       methods without errors etc., but the sound will actually not play.

       This is useful if you plan to use the sound in the game,
       but you don't have actually the sound data (WAV file etc.)
       prepared yet. Then you can write such sound with empty
       file_name and use it everywhere like it would exist.

       Later, when someone will add the actual WAV file, you just
       fill file_name below and everything works.  -->
  <sound name="player_footsteps_watery" file_name="" />
