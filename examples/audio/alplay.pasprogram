{ This is a simple demo of SoundFile unit:
  just load and play given sound file through OpenAL.

  Obviously this is not supposed to be a real music player,
  as OpenAL is not really designed to play music with high quality
  --- OpenAL should be mainly for 3D sounds, where mixing of many sounds
  and spatial sound effects are important.
  Besides, the handling of stereo sounds is different between
  Linux and Windows OpenaL implementations --- Windows impl
  plays sounds stereo and without any spatial sound effects,
  Linux impl converts them to mono sounds and plays with spatial sound effects.
  In the book "Programming Linux games" there were mentions how to
  directly pass some stereo data to OpenAL using Loki extension,
  but I don't know is it still up-to-date information.
