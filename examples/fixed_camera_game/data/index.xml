  TODO: This XML is read for now by simple XMLCfg, that's why it's so
  awkward (e.g. I use "part0", "part1", etc. elements and a "count"
  attribute, while it would be much more natural to just have a
  sequence of "part" elements.

  This will be redone in the future, once I'll get things working.

      <!-- Each state has a url of associated animation.

           Note that all animations should start from time 0,
           strange things could happen otherwise.

           Also, it has a list of what happens when switching to other
           state. For now, this is
           - duration = time in seconds
             of the change from this animation to second one
             (default is 0.5)
           - possibile = False / True (default "true").
             If False, then game mechanics prevent such state change,
             so don't prepare such animation (saves resources and loading
             time).
