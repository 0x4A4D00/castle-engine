# Addresses the warning at ":app:transformClassesWithDexForRelease"
#    To run dex in process, the Gradle daemon needs a larger heap.
#    It currently has approximately 871 MB.
#    For faster builds, increase the maximum heap size for the Gradle daemon to more than 2048 MB.
#    To do this set org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048M in the project gradle.properties.
#    For more information see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048M
