This is the "Kambi VRML game engine",
webpage http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/. It's focus is on 3D games
and applications, in particular using VRML/X3D scene format
(although other 3D formats are supported as well).
http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_game_engine.php
contains a list of features and useful notes for developers.

The API documentation is available online on
http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/reference.php,
it is also available offline in doc/pasdoc/html/ subdirectory of this archive
(just open doc/pasdoc/html/index.html in your WWW browser).

You can compile examples by simple "make examples" executed in this directory.

If you want to use this from Lazarus (http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/),
you'll be interested in installing in Lazarus
packages/kambi_base.lpk and packages/kambi_components.lpk.
