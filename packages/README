Usage:

  1. Open kambi_units.lpk file in Lazarus and compile this package.
  2. When compiling a program that uses my units, just add kambi_units package
     as a "Required Package" for this project.
     (using "Project" -> "Project Inspector" dialog)

  Then you can freely use my units inside your Lazarus programs,
  just like in any FPC program. Lazarus will automatically handle
  things like
  - compiling my units with proper command-line options for FPC
  - passing proper command-line options for FPC when compiling your program
    (like paths to my compiled units)

What kambi_units package is *not*:

  This is only useful to compile all my units and use them nicely
  in your Lazarus programs. This is not needed if you don't use
  Lazarus. Units in this directory don't use any Lazarus units,
  so you don't need to have Lazarus to compile and run them.
  You need only FPC. If you don't want to use Lazarus with my units,
  use ../Makefile to compile all units and use compile.sh scripts
  to compile each particular program. If you need more flexibility,
  take a look at ../../kambi.cfg, this specifies actual options
  used by ../Makefile and all compile.sh scripts.

  This package is *not* meant to be installed in Lazarus.
  There's no reason for this.

  Also note that this package doesn't include all my unit files
  because some unit files do some things that you *do not* want
  to be done in each program that uses my units (and thus
  uses "kambi_units" package), e.g.

  - GLWindow is not included because it initiates TGLWindowManager
    that may initiate some talk with WindowManager, GTK toolkit, etc.
    If you want GLWindow unit, then use kambi_glwindow package
    (that uses kambi_units).

  - GLW_Win, GLW_Demo units are not included because they open OpenGL window,

  In fact *already* there are some units that may init some things
  on startup and thus are potentially unwanted:
  - OpenGLh unit loads OpenGL library, and fails if OpenGL is not available.
    On Win32 this also changes 8087 control word.
  - OpenAL, KambiZlib, KambiPng units load OpenAL, zlib, png
    libraries (but they don't fail if these libraries don't exist).

Some internal notes:

  Useful regexp when synching win32 version with unix version:
    From \.\./\.\./\([.a-z0-9A-Z]*\)/
    To ..\\..\\\1\\

  Remember to put subpaths unix/ and win32/ only in according version
  of the package.
