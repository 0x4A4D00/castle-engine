In this directory you can find a couple of Lazarus packages that allow
to easily use Kambi VRML game engine in Lazarus programs.

----------------------------------------
I. Packages without components:

Usage:

  1. Open wanted kambi_xxx.lpk file in Lazarus and compile the package.

  2. When you want to use the units included in kambi_xxx.lpk
     in your program, just add this kambi_xxx package
     as a "Required Package" for your project
     (using "Project" -> "Project Inspector" dialog).

     That's it. Lazarus will automatically take care of such things as
     recompiling the units in the package when needed (and with
     proper command-line options) or adding
     appropriate -Fu command-line options for FPC so that FPC
     "sees" units in the package when compiling your program.

Mini-FAQ about these packages:

- When compiling kambi_glwindow package, I'm getting error indicating that
  KambiStringUtils unit must be recompiled.

  I don't know the source of this problem, but the workaround is simple:
  recompile kambi_units package explicitly, and then proceed to compiling
  kambi_glwindow.

  In other words, it may be needed to compile kambi_units package twice in a row
  for everything to work Ok.

- Do I need Lazarus to compile Kambi VRML game engine ?

  No. Packages here are provided to easily compile and use the engine
  with Lazarus. But actually units in kambi_vrml_game_engine don't use
  any Lazarus units (LCL) (besides Lazarus-specific components in components/
  subdirectory, but there's not much for now).

  So all you actually need is bare FPC installation.
  Use kambi_vrml_game_engine/Makefile to compile all units and use compile.sh
  scripts to compile each particular program. If you need more flexibility,
  take a look at kambi_vrml_game_engine/kambi.cfg, this specifies actual options
  used by kambi_vrml_game_engine/Makefile and all compile.sh scripts.

- Should I install these packages ?

  Usually, no. Unless you also install kambi_components package (see section below),
  in which case installing kambi_components will require installing also
  kambi_units package.

  If you don't want kambi_components, then there's no point in installing
  kambi_units package (kambi_units doesn't register any components etc.).

  For kambi_glwindow_* packages: you even *should not* install them in Lazarus.
  These packages use GLWindow unit, and merely using this unit
  will cause the program to initialize TGLWindowManager class --- this initiates
  some talk with WindowManager, GTK toolkit, etc. You usually don't want your Lazarus
  installation to do this.

  So kambi_glwindow_* packages are supposed only to be used (that is, required
  by other projects), never installed in Lazarus.

----------------------------------------
II. Package with components (components/kambi_components package):

This is a "normal" Lazarus package, which means that it registers
some Lazarus components (that use my units), and you're supposed to just
install this package in Lazarus. This also automatically installs kambi_units
package --- that's OK.

See ../3dmodels.gl/examples/view3dscene_mini_by_lazarus/
for demo program using this package.
