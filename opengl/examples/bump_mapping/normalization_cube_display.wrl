#VRML V2.0 utf8

# Define DEBUG_SAVE_NORMAL_IMAGES, run bump_mapping (to generate /tmp/xxx
# textures) and then open this file. This will show actual textures
# used as normal maps. Their edges should match seamlessly.
#
# Don't worry about the fact that "negative y" is in topUrl (while it seems
# more sensible to be in bottomUrl),
# (also back and front are reversed, in VRML back is on positive z).
# It seems VRML node Background requires a little
# different layout than ARB_texture_cube_map so that maps match exactly.
# To have the same layout ("negative y" on bottom etc.) some textures should
# probably be reversed (in horizontal and/or vertical), that's just a
# consequence how the direction of textures go in ARB_texture_cube_map.
