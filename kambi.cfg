# syntax options --------------------------------------------------------

# Default mode.
#
# Since 2006-11, I use objfpc mode for everything. Some reasons why it's better
# over delphi mode:
# - There are some things strange in delphi mode, for compat with delphi/tp,
#   that sometimes bite me (like the fact that in FPC >= 2.0.3
#   Single(Integer) makes a variable typecast, not a value typecast).
# - Moreover, ObjFpc has many sensible improvements:
#   the whole way of assigning procedural variables
#   is much better ("@" is required, and assignment is always checked
#   for parameter correctness (in delphi mode @ may be omitted; when it's
#   not omitted, you can cheat and pass procedure with not matching params))
# - Check that method parameter names must differ from class
#   fields/methods/properties --- this is great.
