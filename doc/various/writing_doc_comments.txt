We use PasDoc http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net/ for API documentation.
Michalis, an author of this engine, is also a PasDoc developer,
so suggestions about PasDoc improvements are also welcome :)

We use PasDoc with --auto-abstract option. This is very handy,
and it forces us (in a "good way") to write really good 1st sentence
of every documentation comment. Do's and dont's:

 - Do not start a sentence with "This..", in particular "This function does
   the job of calculating the sensor." or "This returns the calculated sensor
   value." or "This causes sensor value to be calculated."
   or things like that. Usually, the clumsy "This..." part of the sentence
   can be simply removed. Your sentence should simply describe what the
   function / class etc. does, as shortly as possible.

   This problem comes usually from a need to use a verb in the 1st documentation
   sentence. Well, there's no need for it. If you have a function
   named "SensorValue" (although "Sensor" seems even better), then user
   already knows that the "sensor value" is calculated by this function.
   The documentation string can be just "Calculate the sensor value.",
   "The sensor value.", or simply nothing, as the function name already
   says everything.

 - Using "I.e.", especially at the beginning of the sentence, looks
   clumsy and often should be removed, this forces the sentence to be simpler.
   If you *really* have to, start the sentence with "That is".

 - Do not write "Will be called...". Just "Called..." is OK.
