TODO: use Focused = true to draw border around focused viewport
in multple_viewports.

Fix:
      If you want, it's absolutely Ok (even encouraged) to assign
      camera from viewport also to TKamSceneManager.Camera.
      TODO: for now it doesn't work.
  or fix comments, and add some checks, to disallow it?
  What about camera for headlight?

TKamSceneManager.MouseMove
TKamSceneManager.Idle
merge into TKamAbstractViewport

multiple_viewports:
  make one viewport without shadows, other with, screenshot
  implement button as TUIControl, place at the bottom of multiple_viewports
    to fire open 3d file window.
    Also use in terrain to place "open image" near the slider?
  some viewports render with wireframe, by overriding Render* methods.
