TODO: use Focused = true to draw border around focused viewport
in multple_viewports.

Hm, maybe TKamCustomViewport, a common ancestor, with
common Render* methods, from which TKamSceneManager and TkamViewport derive?
This would allow making descendants of TkamViewport with specialized
rendering methods.
E.g. make in multple_viewports two viewports render with wireframe.

Render / Draw stuff move also to TKamAbstractViewport (like RenderEverything).

Fix:
      If you want, it's absolutely Ok (even encouraged) to assign
      camera from viewport also to TKamSceneManager.Camera.
      TODO: for now it doesn't work.
  or fix comments, and add some checks, to disallow it?
  What about camera for headlight?

TKamSceneManager.MouseMove
TKamSceneManager.Idle
merge into TKamAbstractViewport
