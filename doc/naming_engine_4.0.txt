Naming convention:

See also naming_engine_3.0.txt, we follow it, except we surrender
in the case of Castle prefix for unit names.

Generally, we name all units CastleXxx. (Avoiding this prefix in unit name
didn't really work Ok in engine 3.0.0, we had too many generically-named units
that had to be renamed. And having half of the units with Castle prefix, half without
is not consistent. So rename all.)

Classes only use TCastle prefix if they are registered on Lazarus component palette,
or if they really sound overly generic (like TItem, that is now TInventoryItem)
or conflict with widely used (in common RTL, FCL, LCL) identifiers (like TImage,
that is now TCastleImage). Generally we avoid adding prefixes to classes
(or other identifiers), they looked too ugly in engine. Pascal allows to coexist
two equal identifiers in different units without problems, so let's depend on it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unit renames from engine 3.0.0 -> 4.0.0:

(Note: while this seems a lot, many of these units are a little miscellaneous
and you probably use only a little fraction of them (like VectorMath -> CastleVectors,
Boxes3D -> CastleBoxes). Besides, it's probably easier to just recompile your program
instead of looking at this list. Compiler will tell you which units are gone :)

TODO: add here earlier renames from news_xxx

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Units not renamed:

- All units already following CastleXxx (most of them)

- Units from other sources:
  tdxinput_tlb
  pk3dconnexion
  I haven't really decided whether to rename them. Anyway, they are internal
  (normal usage of the engine should not require you to use them),
  so we can later rename them if I hear arguments that it's good thing to do.

- Units named X3D*. There are a lot of them, and I didn't want to make two prefixes
  CastleX3Dxxx.
